## About The Project

I was bored and decided that I wanted an easy way to change all textures in Minecraft to be the same

With this repo you can do the same

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You must have at least node version 13.3
* node
  ```sh
  node --version
  ```

You must have extracted Minecrafts' textures from gamefiles
Here is a [guide](https://www.ravbug.com/tutorials/mc-textures/) to extract texture files

### Running
Before running, make sure you check out the configuration variables available in the `index.js` file

1. Install dependancies 
```sh 
    npm i
```
2. Build the texture pack
```sh 
    node index.js
```
3. Profit?? ðŸ˜•
